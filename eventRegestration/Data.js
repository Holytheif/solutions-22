Two-hour window will be open for the teams to interact with the judges related to their problem domain.<br>7. Judging criteria: Teams will be judged on these four criteria. Judges will weigh the criteria equally. During judging, participants should try to describe what they did for each criterion in their prototype.<br><br><b>A. <u>Technology</u>:</b> How technically impressive was the idea?<br>  Was the technical problem the team tackled difficult?<br>  Did it use a particularly clever technique or did it use many different components?<br> <br><b>B. <u>Design</u>:</b>  Did the team put thought into the user experience?<br> How well designed is the interface?<br> For a hardware project, it might be more about how good human-computer interaction is.<br><br><b> C. <u>Completion</u>:</b><br> Does the prototype work?<br> Is it feasible?<br> Did the team achieve everything they wanted?<br> <b>D. <u>Learning:</u></b>  Did the team stretch themselves?. <br> Did they try to learn something new?. <br> What kind of projects have they worked on before?. <br> <br><b>E.<u> Prototype:</u></b>You are strongly encouraged to present a prototype of what you have built.<br> Only including presentations are discouraged. You are not judged on the quality of your idea. As you are judged on what you built, you'll only hurt yourself by not showing a demo.<br> You are encouraged to present what you have done even if your prototype is broken or you weren’t able to finish.<br><br> 8. Teams can be disqualified from the competition at the organizers&#39; discretion. Reasons might include but are not limited to breaking the Competition Rules or other unsporting behaviour.<br> 9. Updated information related to the event will be email-d to the participants before time<br>10. These criteria will guide judges but ultimately judges are free to make decisions based on their gut feeling of which projects are the most impressive and most deserving.",
